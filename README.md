This project analyzes a credit card transaction dataset to detect fraudulent activities using R programming. The dataset includes transaction details, demographic information, and geolocation data. By applying statistical methods and machine learning, the project aims to identify patterns, assess risk factors, and accurately classify fraudulent transactions for enhanced financial security.
To detect fraudulent transactions using R programming and Power BI, a range of tools and techniques is employed for effective data analysis and visualization. In R, packages like `dplyr` and `tidyr` are essential for cleaning and transforming the dataset, while `ggplot2` and `corrplot` help visualize patterns and relationships. For geospatial data, tools like `geosphere` and `leaflet` calculate distances and create interactive maps. Statistical methods are implemented using the `stats` package, while advanced machine learning models, such as random forests, gradient boosting, and support vector machines, are built with `caret`, `randomForest`, and `xgboost`. 
Additionally, date and time data are handled using `lubridate`, and efficient data reading is supported by `readr` and `data.table`. Once insights are generated, Power BI is used to create dynamic dashboards that allow stakeholders to explore trends and visualize key metrics interactively. These dashboards provide a real-time overview of transaction activities, highlighting anomalies for quick detection. By combining R for detailed analysis and Power BI for user-friendly reporting, the project delivers a robust solution to understand and mitigate credit card fraud effectively.
